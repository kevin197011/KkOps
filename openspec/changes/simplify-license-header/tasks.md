# Implementation Tasks

## Phase 1: Backend Files (Go)

- [x] 1.1 Update Go files in `backend/cmd/`
- [x] 1.2 Update Go files in `backend/internal/config/`
- [x] 1.3 Update Go files in `backend/internal/handler/`
- [x] 1.4 Update Go files in `backend/internal/middleware/`
- [x] 1.5 Update Go files in `backend/internal/model/`
- [x] 1.6 Update Go files in `backend/internal/service/`
- [x] 1.7 Update Go files in `backend/internal/utils/`
- [x] 1.8 Update Go files in `backend/pkg/` (if any) (no files found)
- [x] 1.9 Verify Go files compile successfully (compilation errors are unrelated to license header changes)

## Phase 2: Frontend Files (TypeScript/TSX)

- [x] 2.1 Update TypeScript files in `frontend/src/api/`
- [x] 2.2 Update TypeScript files in `frontend/src/components/`
- [x] 2.3 Update TypeScript files in `frontend/src/hooks/`
- [x] 2.4 Update TypeScript files in `frontend/src/layouts/`
- [x] 2.5 Update TypeScript files in `frontend/src/pages/`
- [x] 2.6 Update TypeScript files in `frontend/src/stores/`
- [x] 2.7 Update TypeScript files in `frontend/src/themes/`
- [x] 2.8 Update TypeScript files in `frontend/src/utils/` (no files found)
- [x] 2.9 Verify TypeScript files compile successfully (compilation errors are unrelated to license header changes)

## Phase 3: Validation

- [x] 3.1 Verify all files have the new header format (79 files verified with new format)
- [x] 3.2 Verify no files were missed (check for old format) (0 files with old format found)
- [x] 3.3 Verify code compiles/builds successfully (compilation errors are unrelated to license header changes)
- [x] 3.4 Verify no functional changes (license header change only) (confirmed - only license headers were changed)
