# Change: Add Branding Logo and Icon

## Why

Currently, the KkOps platform uses default Vite icons and lacks a distinctive visual identity. A custom logo and icon set will:
- Establish brand recognition and professionalism
- Improve user experience with consistent visual branding
- Support the platform's identity across different contexts (browser tabs, bookmarks, documentation)
- Align with the Swiss Modernism 2.0 + Minimalism design system already in use

## What Changes

- **ADDED**: Custom logo design for KkOps platform
- **ADDED**: Favicon and app icons in multiple sizes (16x16, 32x32, 192x192, 512x512)
- **ADDED**: SVG versions of logo/icon for scalability and theme adaptation
- **ADDED**: Integration of logo/icon in frontend (HTML, layout components)
- **ADDED**: Dark mode variant support for icon/logo

## Impact

- Affected code: Frontend HTML, layout components, public assets
- Affected files: `frontend/index.html`, `frontend/public/`, layout components (MainLayout, Login page)
- Design system: Visual identity aligned with Swiss Modernism 2.0 + Minimalism principles
- User experience: Improved branding consistency across the platform
